This is a project that I take great pride in, which involved using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to visualize COVID-19 data. 
The project consisted of producing a bar chart displaying total deaths by state, a scatter plot featuring moving averages of deaths across time, and a histogram showing daily death frequencies in Oregon. 
This task improved my abilities in data visualization, graph modification, and programmatic handling of real-world datasets.
